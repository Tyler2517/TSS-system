This project combines Django for the backend API and React (Vite) for the frontend, all containerized with Docker for easy development and deployment.

Prerequisites
Docker
Docker Compose (included with Docker Desktop)
Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <project-directory>
2. Start the application
bash
docker-compose up --build
This command will:

Build the Docker images for both frontend and backend
Start the containers
Run database migrations for Django
Start the Django development server on port 8000
Start the Vite development server on port 5173
3. Access the application
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend API: http://localhost:8000
Django Admin: http://localhost:8000/admin
Development
Making changes
Thanks to the volume mounts in the Docker configuration, you can edit files directly on your host machine:

Backend changes will be reflected immediately (Django's auto-reload)
Frontend changes will be reflected immediately (Vite's hot module replacement)
Running commands inside containers
To run commands inside the containers:

bash
# Django management commands
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py <command>

# Example: Create a Django superuser
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser

# Frontend npm commands
docker-compose exec frontend npm <command>
Adding new dependencies
Backend (Python packages)
Add the package to backend/requirements.txt
Rebuild the container: docker-compose build backend
Frontend (npm packages)
Run: docker-compose exec frontend npm install <package-name>
The package will be added to package.json automatically
Stopping the application
bash
# Stop the containers but keep the data
docker-compose down

# Stop the containers and remove volumes (will delete database data)
docker-compose down -v
Production Deployment
For production deployment, additional configuration is recommended:

Configure proper environment variables
Set up a production database
Configure static file serving
Add SSL/TLS certificates
Set up a proper web server like Nginx
Technologies Used
Backend: Django, Django REST Framework
Frontend: React, Vite
Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
